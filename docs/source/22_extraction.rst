Metrics extraction configuration
================================

Include
-------
``include`` keyword is available to add a file to the list of configuration files to be loaded.

include=<full path to configuration file>
  ``<full path to configuration file>`` is the full path to the configuration 
  file to add at the end of the list of configuration files to be loaded.

  .. hint:: The initial order of information displayed in status page depends on the
            order of file inclusion.

Static
------
``static`` is definign KPI which is not changing over the time. KPI are extracted 
once at ``rpimonitord`` startup (example: memory size, disk size, network bandwidth limit...). 

Each static KPI is identified into the configuration file by a line starting with the 
keyword ``static``, an identifier ``<static data id>`` and the following parameters.

.. important:: Inside a configuration file ``<static data id>`` should be unique per KPI. 

static.<static data id>.name=<data name>
  ``<data name>`` is a string representing the KPI or the list of KPI
  separated by comma. Each name has to be unique.
  Only alpha numerical charter and underscore are accepted.

  .. danger:: Do not use ``-`` in ``data name``: This is a limitation of javascript.

static.<static data id>.source=<data source>
  ``<data source>`` is a file or an executable file within the path.
  If the file exists, ``rpimonitord`` will read its content. If the file
  is not existing, ``rpimonitord`` will try to execute it and will parse
  the output.

  .. note:: In ``<data source>`` it is possible to refer to another ``<data name>``
            with the prefix ``data.`` followed by ``<data name>``. This data could 
            refer to ``dynamic`` or ``static`` KPI. 
            
            **Example**: ``data.kernel_version``

            .. important:: The order of KPI extraction is important.

                           Data used should already been extracted to be accessible.

static.<static data id>.regexp=<data regexp>
  ``<data regexp>`` is the regular expression extracting information from
  data source. Regexp groups ``()`` has to be used to extract the data
  In case of KPI list, each group will be affected to a KPI name.

static.<static data id>.postprocess=<data postprocess>
  ``<data postprocess>`` is an expression defining the postprocessing formula or the
  list of postprocessing formula (comma separated) to be applied on result.
  Each result is processed individually and is identified by ``$1``
  This parameter will be evaluate by the command eval of ``perl``.

Dynamic
-------
Dynamic KPI are extracted periodically (defined by ``daemon.delay``).
Each KPI is identified into the conf file by a line stating with the keyword 
``dynamic``, an identifier ``<dynamic data id>`` and the following parameters:

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.name=<data name>
  ``<data name>`` is a string representing the KPI or the list of KPI
  separated by comma. Each name has to be unique.
  Only alpha numerical charter and underscore are accepted.

  .. danger:: Do not use ``-`` in ``data name``: This is a limitation of javascript.

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.source=<data source>
  ``<data source>`` is a file or an executable program within the path.
  If the file exists, ``rpimonitord`` will read its content. If the file
  is not existing, ``rpimonirotd`` will try to execute it and will parse
  the output.

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.regexp=<data regexp>
  ``<data regexp>`` is the regular expression extracting information from
  data source. Regexp groups ``()`` has to be used to extract the data
  In case of KPI list, each group will be affected to a KPI name.

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.postprocess=<data postprocess>
  ``<data postprocess>`` is an expression defining the postprocessing formula or the
  list of postprocessing formula (comma separated) to be applied on result.
  Each result is processed individually and is identified by ``$1``
  This parameter will be evaluate by the command eval of ``perl``.

  .. note:: Static values are accessible for the post processing using the
            variable ``$this->{'static'}->{'static_data_name'}`` and can be used.
            You can refer to swap data extraction to see an example (cf. ``swap.conf``).

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.interval=<interval>
  ``rpimonitord`` extracts data every ``daemon.delay`` seconds. ``<interval>``
  define how many loop have to be waited before extracting this data.
  Default value is ``1``. This means that data is extracted at every loop.

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.default=<default>
  If ``rpimonitord`` can't extract information, it is possible to define
  a ``<default>`` value which will be set for the KPI or defaults values of a list 
  of KPI separated by comma.

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.rrd=<GAUGE|COUNTER|DERIVE|ABSOLUTE|COMPUTE>
  ``rrd`` parameter is defining if the KPI has to be stored into a RRD
  database and how ``<GAUGE|COUNTER|DERIVE|ABSOLUTE|COMPUTE>``. If the
  parameter is defined as empty, no RRD database will be created. If
  this parameter is defined, a RRD database will be created and data
  will be stored at every extraction.
  Note: If this parameter is defined the ``name``parameter cannot exceed 19 chars.
  Ref `RRDTool documentation <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdcreate.en.html>`_ 
  for RRD parameter description.

**dynamic.<dynamic data id>.min=<minimal value acceptable in RRD>**

dynamic.<dynamic data id>.max=<maximal value acceptable in RRD>
  If a value extracted by is less than minimal of greater than maximal
  value, it will not be stored into RRD database as unknown.
  These limits are usefull to handle counter that fall down to 0 when
  they reach their limit (Ex: network graphs)

  .. note:: Static values are accessible for the post processing using the
            variable ``$this->{'static'}->{'static_data_name'}`` and can be used.
            You can refer to swap data extraction to see an example.

SNMP OID
--------

  **RPi-Monitor** is able to act as an snmp-agent. Snmp configuration is based
  on KPI name. KPI could be ``static`` or ``dynamic``.

  snmp.<kpi name>.id=<id>
    ``<id>`` is the last number of OID appended at the end of OID configuration
    defined for snmp agent. (ref. SNMP agent configuration section)

  snmp.<kpi name>.type=<type>
    Type of data can be : ``counter``, ``counter64``, ``gauge``, ``integer``, 
    ``ipaddr``, ``ipaddress``, ``netaddr``, ``objectid``, ``octetstr``, 
    ``string``, ``timeticks``

  snmp.<kpi name>.description=<text description>
    Description of KPI to be added in MIB

  snmp.<kpi name>.postprocess=<formula>
    Post process formula to apply to KPI before sending over SNMP.
    Ex: Convert float to interger by mutiplying by 100: ``$1*100``

Commands to use to get MIB information:

Snmp Configuration
  See configuration file example in ``/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.rpimonitor``
  and activate pass_persist extension
  
Extract MIB from **RPi-Monitor**
  ``rpimonitord -m > ~/mib.txt``
  
Get data from SNMP
  ``snmpwalk -v 2c -m ~/mib.txt -c public 127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.54321.42``
